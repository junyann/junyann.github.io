  I am a second-year PhD student at University of Southern California (USC). I am fortunately advised by [Prof. Xiang Ren](http://ink-ron.usc.edu/xiangren/). My research focuses on <mark>Commonsense Reasoning</mark> and <mark>Information Extraction</mark>. I am currently interested in how to leverage external knowledge to benefit machine learning models, especially in low-resource scenarios.

  You can find my CV [here](static/CV_Jun_Yan.pdf).
