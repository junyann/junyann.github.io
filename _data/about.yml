  I am a Research Scientist at [Google Cloud AI Research](https://research.google/teams/cloud-ai). I obtained my PhD from University of Southern California (USC), advised by [Prof. Xiang Ren](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~xiangren/).

  My research focuses on building trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. Specifically, I'm interested in <mark>alignment</mark>, <mark>safety</mark>, and <mark>robustness</mark> of Large Language Models (LLMs).

  You can find my CV [here](static/CV_Jun_Yan.pdf).
